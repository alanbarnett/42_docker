# 14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The
# container should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port
# of the virtual machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool
# container as a database service. You can try to access lair on your machine
# via a web browser, with the IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.
# Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress webrise in two
# commands!
