# 28. ... Damn it, a group of zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting
# down the engineering-bay service won't help at all... You must send a troup
# of Marines to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two
# replicas, and make sure that the service works properly (see the
# documentation provided at hub.docker.com). This service will be named...
# marines and will be on the overmind network.
